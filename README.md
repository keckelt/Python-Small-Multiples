# Instructions

## Development Environment
You can either work online, via MyBinder, or locally.

### MyBinder

Go to: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/keckelt/Python-Small-Multiples/master
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/keckelt/Python-Small-Multiples/master)
 and open the *template* notebook.

### Local
Checkout this repo and change into the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/keckelt/Python-Small-Multiples.git
cd Python-Small-Multiples/
```

You can reuse the conda environment from the tutorial:
```
conda activate python-tutorial
```

Then launch Jupyter :
```
jupyter notebook
```

Goto http://localhost:8888/ and open the *template* notebook.

## Tasks
1. Inspect the data and attributes, e.g., with [head()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html), and [dtypes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dtypes.html#pandas.DataFrame.dtypes).
3. The dataset contains players of ten different leagues. Create a small multiples visualisation that shows the age distribution of the players for each league.
5. Make a screenshot of your small multiples and submit it.
